The premier martial arts high school in the entire country...
I've dreamed of going here since my dad taught me my first kick.

Chimpston: Yes?
Saki: Ugh, it's Brad. He's such a dingus.
Chimpston: Well, maybe I can cheer you up!
Chimpston (thinking): (I've known you for so long...)

Chimstpon: (...no matter how far apart we've drifted)
Chimpston: (Perhaps now is my chance, but I need to be careful)
Chimpston: (I must strike the balance between comforting you...)
Chimpston (AND WINNING YOUR HEART!)
C O M B O S A T I O N  S T A R T !!
Saki: I feel like Brad never listens to me...
