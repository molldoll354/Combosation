Cross-Up High...
The premier martial arts high school in the entire country...
I've dreamed of going here since my dad taught me my first kick.
And now it's a reality.
But more importantly...it's where I'll get to see Saki again. 
I've known Saki for as long as I can remember.
We grew up side by side.
(Though, she's always been the better fighter than I)
Even though I never told her...
I've always loved her...
Perhaps this year will be my chance, but I need to be careful.
I must strike the balance between fighting for glory...
AND FIGHTING FOR YOUR HEART!
