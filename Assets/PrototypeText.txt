Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.  
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

B: And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
And summer’s fleece hath all too short a cape
And I forgot a jacket, mate

D: By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
By chance, Nature’s changing horse, such whims;
I did not memorize this sonnet, just skimmed


F: When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
When in herbal lines do Thyme doth grow’st
May I offer thee a bowl of these oats


G:   So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
 So long as men can see, or eyes can breathe,
In her sepulchre there by the sea— 
  
G:    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
So long lives thee, and thee to me
In her tomb by the sounding sea.
